  * Use Pomodoro - 25 min work, 5 min break, 5 min context switching
  * 8 hrs = 13 poms; 1 pom for lunch; 5 poms for helping others. So 6 poms for work
  * set micro goals for each pom - keep writing what you are doing in the current pom
  * Master the interruptions - externalize your current context by taking good notes. This makes it easy to stop a pom at 25 min sharp and deal with interruptions \(only critical ones\)
