# ðŸŽ‰ Home

Welcome to **Ann's Knowledge Hub** - a place where I publish and share what have I learned through many years, and I am still learning as a software developer. This includes code snippets, debugging tricks, good reference articles, problems I faced and how I solved them, and my own how-to guides for technology. It also includes many key concepts I have learned, mainly on iOS platform, but also other stuff like Git, CI/CD etc. I am consolidating more and more content from various sources including my personal notes in Obsidian, physical notebooks, GitHub etc.

### Why I created this space

I know this site will be a tiny drop in the sea of thousands of such sites and resources out there. But this is just an attempt to do my part in sharing what I have learned, hoping that someone will find this useful. At the very least, I come here and refer to many how-to guides regularly.&#x20;

Another reason to create this space was the inspiration from my two core principles of life - **Learn something new every day** and **Be the change you want to See.**

I believe in continuous learning and sharing what I learn with others to help them along their journey.

This knowledge hub is built using [GitBook](https://www.gitbook.com/about), a fantastic doc generator that provides rich content editing, easy edit/publish workflow and seamless integration with GitHub.&#x20;

I love it! :hearts: It is awesome and free for personal use.
