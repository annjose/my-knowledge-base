# Google Calendar API

Google's calendar API can be used to get calendar events of a user after \(s\)he has authorized the app.

### Learnings

* Very easy to use. The [Quickstart guide](https://developers.google.com/calendar/quickstart/ios) was very helpful
* Tried it during the QBSE mobile hack-day 3/30/18 to match calendar events to unreviewed trips.
* Made a working demo of the code
* Pranay registered the iOS app in QBSE's Google developer account and thus got the client id.
